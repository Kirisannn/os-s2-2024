2b)	One stack per thread.

3a)	Non Pre-emptive:	Tasks must continue to completion, before the next task begins.
	Pre-emptive:		Process can be interrupted for higher priority tasks.
	
	Why Pre-emptive?
		e.g. 1 OS should get priority before a process like openning firefox.
		e.g. 2 Alt+F4 takes precedence over any application processes.
